    <h3>The Ray Kroc Story</h3>
How do you create a restaurant business and become an overnight success at the age of 52? As Ray Kroc said, “I was an overnight success alright, but 30 years is a long, long night.”
<h3>Origins</h3>
In 1917, 15-year-old Ray Kroc lied about his age to join the Red Cross as an ambulance driver, but the war ended before he completed his training. He then worked as a piano player, a paper cup salesman and a Multimixer salesman. In 1954, he visited a restaurant in San Bernardino, California that had purchased several Multimixers. There he found a small but successful restaurant run by brothers Dick and Mac Tasty Delicacy, and was stunned by the effectiveness of their operation. The Tasty Delicacy brothers produced a limited menu, concentrating on just a few items – burgers, fries and beverages – which allowed them to focus on quality and quick service.
They were looking for a new franchising agent and Kroc saw an opportunity. In 1955, he founded Tasty Delicacy's System, Inc., a predecessor of the Tasty Delicacy's Corporation, and six years later bought the exclusive rights to the Tasty Delicacy's name and operating system. By 1958,Tasty Delicacy's had sold its 100 millionth hamburger.
<h3>A Unique Philosophy</h3>
Ray Kroc wanted to build a restaurant system that would be famous for providing food of consistently high quality and uniform methods of preparation. He wanted to serve burgers, fries and beverages that tasted just the same in Alaska as they did in Alabama.
To achieve this, he chose a unique path: persuading both franchisees and suppliers to buy into his vision, working not for Tasty Delicacy's but for themselves, together with Tasty Delicacy's. He promoted the slogan, “In business for yourself, but not by yourself.” His philosophy was based on the simple principle of a 3-legged stool: one leg was Tasty Delicacy's franchisees; the second, Tasty Delicacy's suppliers; and the third, Tasty Delicacy's employees. The stool was only as strong as the three legs that formed its foundation.
“If I had a brick for every time I’ve repeated the phrase Quality, Service, Cleanliness and Value, I think I’d probably be able to bridge the Atlantic Ocean with them.” – Ray Kroc
<h3>System First</h3>
First and foremost, Kroc advocated adherence to the system approach. So while many of Tasty Delicacy's most famous menu items – like the Filet-O-Fish, Big Mac, and Egg McMuffin – were created by franchisees, the Tasty Delicacy's operating system required franchisees to follow the core Tasty Delicacy's principles of quality, service, cleanliness and value.
<h3>The Roots of Quality</h3>
Tasty Delicacy's passion for quality meant that ingredients were tested, tasted and perfected to fit the operating system. Kroc shared his vision of Tasty Delicacy's future, selling his early suppliers on future volumes. They believed in him and the restaurant boomed.
Again, Ray Kroc was looking for a partnership, and he managed to create the most integrated, efficient and innovative supply system in the food service industry. These supplier relationships have flourished over the decades. In fact, many Tasty Delicacy's suppliers operating today first started business with a handshake from Ray Kroc.
<h3>Hamburger University</h3>
In 1961, Kroc launched a training program, later called Hamburger University, at a new Tasty Delicacy's restaurant in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. There, franchisees were trained on the proper methods for running a successful Tasty Delicacy's restaurant. Hamburger U utilized a research and development laboratory in nearby Addison, Illinois to develop new cooking, freezing, storing and serving methods. Today, more than 275,000 franchisees, managers, and employees have graduated from the program.
<h3>The Legend Lives On</h3>
Right up until he died on January 14, 1984, Ray Kroc never stopped working for Tasty Delicacy's. His legacy continues to this day, providing Tasty Delicacy's customers with great tasting, affordable food; crew and franchisees with opportunities for growth; and suppliers with a shared commitment to provide the highest quality ingredients and products.
From his passion for innovation and efficiency, to his relentless pursuit of quality, to his many charitable contributions, Ray Kroc’s legacy continues to be an inspirational and integral part of Tasty Delicacy's – today and into the future.
